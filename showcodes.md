### Show Code #5 on 10/11 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs just fine. Uses actors.

### Show Code #8 on 11/8 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs fine. Note that it is customary for file names to match the primary class/object inside of
them. You changed the object in the file Main to be called Server. Either the file should be called Server.scala or the
object should be called Main. I prefer the latter because the sbt configuration is set up to run mud.Main.

### Show Code #11 on 12/4 (4 of 4 points)

Code is there and compiles.

### Final Project MUD Component (10 of 10 points)
